This will let you type a file name in Alfred and turn that into a plain-text note with a .md extension that'll open in your default text editor ([iA Writer](http://iawriter.com/) for me). It'll then put in your Alfred query in the top line of your note as the title.

You'll need to add the file paths for your notes folder in the bash script.
